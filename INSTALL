`cPhyProb` Installation
=======================

`cPhyProb` is a python package with C extensions. To build from source, you must
have a C compiler (see python setuptools and distutils packages for details on
how to configure your C compiler if build fails).  After changing directory to 
the top of the package you should be able to install by simply invoking:

::
  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

To see the installation options use:

::
  python setup.py install --help

When using the beagle-lib option, you will need to set BEAGLE_LIB_DIR to the
"prefix" directory where you have installed BEAGLE_LIB_DIR (if that dir was not
/usr/local).

Currently Beagle-lib will not compile for a "fat" binary on Mac (ppc and i386
architecture), so you may need to edit your Makefile in the python config 
directory -- On my machine this file was in 
	/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.6/config/Makefile
because my python exeutable is in:
	/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python
The change that you need to make to the Makefile is the removal of the compile
option "-arch ppc" wherever it occurs in the file.  Save a backup of the original
python Makefile.
