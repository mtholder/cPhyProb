`cPhyProb` Overview
===================

cPhyProb is a package implementing some probability calculations used in 
calculating likelihoods on phylogenies. Computationally intensive steps are 
programmed as C-extensions to python.  The package as expected to be used within
the context of software that has data structures for trees (such as the arbol_
package).

This is a work in progress and many of the functions and classes are written for
teaching purposes rather than speed.

Road Map
========

* implement basic models and routines needed to calculate the likelihood of a 
  tree.
